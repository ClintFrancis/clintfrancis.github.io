<blockquote>
  <p><em>The first machine age, the Industrial Revolution, saw the automation of physical work. We are now living in the second machine age, in which there is increasing augmentation and automation of manual and cognitive work.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p><sup><strong>Jamie Yoder | 2016 | Insurance Thought Leadership</strong></sup></p>

<p>Today, Ai is ubiquitous across the commercial industry. It’s is already deeply embedded in thousands of products we already use every day: From search engines and virtual assistants to product recommendations, traffic control, healthcare, insurance and more.</p>

<p>Over the last few years Ai has seen rapid advances due to the exponential growth in distributed computing power alongside the global connectivity of both people and machines.</p>

<p>This new level of connectivity is responsible for the generation of massive amounts of structured and unstructured data, providing fuel to train these AI algorithms at a scale never previously possible. In turn we are able to extract meaningful and actionable insights from a sea of information.</p>

<p>Cloud computing in particular has brought immense computing power to our everyday lives. Our personal connected devices (phones, smart speakers, fitness trackers etc) enable a two way stream of information. They provide contextual data on what we do, where we go, how we feel and return actionable insights and predictions from the cloud to assist us.</p>

<p>AI-infused apps, or “smart apps” are growing in popularity among users as they conveniently help accomplish daily tasks. Take a calendar app for example; by enabling location access on our mobile the app could provide up to the minute personalised travel advice based on your schedule, the weather, traffic and your movement history.</p>

<h2 id="defining-artificial-intelligence">Defining Artificial Intelligence</h2>

<p>The term “artificial intelligence” is often misused. To avoid any confusion over what AI means, it’s worth clarifying its scope and definition.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>AI is Intelligence demonstrated by machines, in contrast to the natural intelligence (NI) displayed by humans and other animals. In computer science AI research is defined as the study of “intelligent agents”: any device that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximise its chance of successfully achieving its goals. Colloquially, the term “artificial intelligence” is applied when a machine mimics “cognitive” functions that humans associate with other human minds, such as “learning” and “problem solving”</em>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence">Artificial intelligence | Wikipedia</a>
</sup></p>

<p>To further refine that idea, lets instead reframe the concept of AI across three broad categories:</p>

<h4 id="cognitive-computing">Cognitive Computing</h4>
<p>Cognitive Computing is the simulation of human thought processes in a computerised model. Cognitive computing involves self-learning systems that use data mining, pattern recognition and natural language processing to mimic the way the human brain works. Cognitive Computing is derived from models built using Machine Learning.</p>

<h4 id="machine-learning">Machine Learning</h4>
<p>Machine Learning is the ability for computers to learn without being explicitly programmed (Intelligent Agents). Machine Learning focuses on the development of computer programs that can change when exposed to new data, improving their algorithms automatically through experience.</p>

<h4 id="data-science">Data Science</h4>
<p>Data Science is an interdisciplinary field about scientific methods, processes and systems to extract knowledge or insights from data in various forms, either structured or unstructured. Data Science unifies concepts from statistics, data analysis, and machine learning in order to understand and analyse events.</p>

<p>Throughout this blog I’ll exploring concepts and examples around both Cognitive Computing and Machine Learning. And while I may touch a bit on Data Science its not going to be an area of focus.</p>

<h2 id="ai-adoption">AI Adoption</h2>

<p>So the claim is that AI has the potential to completely revolutionise existing industries as we know them today, but what’s happening right now? Given the breadth of AI, its no surprise to find that different industries have found their own applications for the technology. Below are some examples that illustrate how AI is currently being adopted and its many different use cases:</p>

<h4 id="banking-and-finance">Banking and Finance</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Banks and financial institutions are using chatbots to improve customer experience.</li>
  <li>AI driven personalised communications and advice via robo-advisors based on a users financial habits.</li>
  <li>Online wealth management services that provide automated, algorithm-based portfolio management advice without the help of a human counterpart.</li>
  <li>Using voice-powered AI to interact with a banking account using natural language queries. For example, instead of requesting a current balance users could ask “How much did I spend on groceries this month?”.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="retail">Retail</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Visual Search - the ability to make items within pictures shoppable. You see something you like, but you don’t know the name or where to get it, or you just want something similar.</li>
  <li>Chatbots as a personification of the brand.</li>
  <li>Adaptive, in-the-moment personalisation — AI that can infer  what a shopper’s style is and adapt its recommendations as they shop.</li>
  <li>Visual analytics measuring shoppers brand and product interactions within a physical space.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="insurance">Insurance</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Screen applicants or claims quickly by cross referencing information about a particular home or neighbourhood from a variety of sources.</li>
  <li>Chatbots that learn from their interactions with customers to improve service over time.</li>
  <li>Identify, assess, and underwrite emerging risks and identify new revenue sources</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="media">Media</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Synthesise intelligent summaries of content within any vertical.</li>
  <li>Ingest trends from social networks and collate large stories faster than humans can discover them.</li>
  <li>Dynamically monitor advertising campaigns to provide publishers insight on how their branded content impacts audiences in realtime.</li>
  <li>Contextually relevancy news for individuals served at the right time and in the right place.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="healthcare">Healthcare</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Inexpensive screening to anyone with smartphone; Patients can submit their own pictures and have AI identify potential diseases, such as skin cancer, more accurately and in their early stages.</li>
  <li>Consumer wearables and other medical devices combined with AI can oversee early-stage heart disease, enabling doctors and other caregivers to better monitor and detect potentially life-threatening episodes at earlier.</li>
  <li>Using pattern recognition both locally and globally to identify patients at risk of developing a condition.</li>
  <li>Drug research and discovery.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="legal">Legal</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Virtual assistants that search through vast databases of legal documents and return an answer paired with a confidence rating.</li>
  <li>Legal document generation and review.</li>
  <li>Chatbots that appeal existing fines through a series of simple questions.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="travel">Travel</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Travel prediction based on schedule and previous choices.</li>
  <li>Concierge services for travellers that predict preferences, personalise services, complete bookings and manage in-trip and post-trip needs.</li>
  <li>Alerting commuters where they’re most likely to find a seat, depending on the location and direction of their specific journey.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="field-services">Field Services</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Combining AI and IoT (Internet of Things) to predict service and maintenance needs based on historical data, this way service can be provided before the machine fails.</li>
  <li>Dynamic scheduling and prioritising for field workers based on their location, time, and other parameters.</li>
  <li>Virtual assistants for hands free operation.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

<p>If you’re interested in how AI is likely to impact your industry, it will be critical to keep an eye on currently emerging trends. Advances in AI have been moving at a rapid pace, and its only over the last few years that companies outside of the tech sphere have started to invest in earnest. Whether you’re starting out in this space, or already on your way, there’s a world of new opportunities for both businesses and individuals alike - the exciting part is seeing what happens next.</p>
